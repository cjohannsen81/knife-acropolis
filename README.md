You can add this plugin to you normal knife plugin path (like ~/.chef/plugins/knife/) or download it as a gem:

	knife acropolis snapshot delete (options)
	knife acropolis snapshot list (options)
	knife acropolis task list (options)
	knife acropolis vdisk list (options)
	knife acropolis vm list (options)
	

You can also add the static options like host, username and password to your knife.rb configuration:

	knife[:a_host] = "yourhost.com"
	knife[:a_user] = "yourUsername"
	knife[:a_pass] = "yourPassword"
